# Jarvis-artificial-intelligence
Made using Python

I only tested Jarvis on windows, but it should runn on other operating sistems if required modules installed.

To use it:
Putt 'Jarvis.py' in a specific folder named as you whant.
Make a folder named 'music' into the folder cantaining 'Jarvis.py' and put some mp3 music files theire so that Jarvis can find music
and play if you ask him to. The speekmodule.py must be in the same folder thein Jarvis.py.
Install all requested modules (see the import list in the script) and runn Jarvis.
Jarvis uses google for converting speech to text, so you must be connected to wifi or ethernet. 

Enjoy :D
