# Jarvis-artificial-intelligence
Jarvis is a personal assistant made using Python.
It is coded in a structured way so that you can easily understaind and modify the code for your needs. 
I only tested Jarvis on windows, but it should runn on other operating sistems if required modules are installed.

To use it:
Putt 'Jarvis.py' in a specific folder named as you will.
Make a folder named 'music' into the folder cantaining 'Jarvis.py', put some mp3 music files theire so that Jarvis can find and play it if you ask him to by saying 'play music' or just 'music'. speekmodule.py and Jarvis.py must be in the same folder.
Install all requested modules (pyaudio, speech_recognition, pygame, socket, webbrowser, subprocess, glob, gtts, os, random,) some of 
these modules are preinstalled with Python.
Jarvis uses google for converting speech to text, so you need an internet connection. 

Enjoy :D
